  Flex API

<h2>Description</h2>

FLEX API is an application that involves transferring a substantial volume of data to a database to imitate a real world database. I then tested 
to see if the latency and throughput was production level but it failed the test. I did some research to see what I could implement to optimize the project a
and implemented them massively improving the latency and throughput.
