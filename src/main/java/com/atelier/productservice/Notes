Things I'm learning in this project.
I'm improving with the things I've learned before and finding things that are missing in my knowledge, such as





Insert all items to the database.
Look at what ProductsModel is doing
Once we can get the data from that, then do the artillery test right away.
If its slow, try to see if there's any way to go about it
gitignore for properties and schema.sql

The test that Artillery is doing
port = 3000
   db_host = 'localhost'
   db_user =  'root'
   db_password = 'study123'
   db_name = 'sdc'
